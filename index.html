      We are building Zapier for the Enterprise
    </h1>
    <p>
      Magick API aims at giving back power and flexibility to Organizations. Create multi-steps workflows between ERP, proprietary software, legacy applications and hosted applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connect your systems altogether and build your own data bus. Automate tedious tasks and orchestrate data flow through user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Host our solution behind your firewall. Define (REST) APIs as your enterprise grow and automate as much as possible. We play nice with your favourite external services but our target is all the other core apps that your enterpise relies on.
